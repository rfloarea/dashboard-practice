# Dashboard Practice
Building a dashboard under tight time constraints is good practice. This was a one day project. I'll come back to it from time to time, but mostly just to make myself laugh. I had fun making this.

Dam, what a fun challenge! Don't know why, but I set out to complete this in a day. Which I guess I did? I mean, it's not a *functional* dashboard, but when has functionality every stopped anyone from shipping things?

## What I did
I made a thing! It uses grid and flexbox and fun little css tricks. Also going from start to finish in one day was something of a challenge. It's late and I'm tired but I also feel like I can just keep going. (Should watch out for that)

## What I learned

1. I like taking the HTML setup very slow and steady and methodical. I felt actually peaceful while building the initial HTML. By peaceful I mean, my mind was clear, I little to no mental chatter. I was nice.
2. Flexybox and Grid are great together! I'm mostly just excited for me comfort with these tools to grow.
3. The best way for me to get better is to put myself into situations where the demands are high but attainable. I never felt incapable of solving today's problems. Even when I "didn't know what to do". I just sought clarity when I needed it and instruction when necessary. I didn't spend too much time chasing rabbits. Focus.
4. Don't overthink solutions. There are many ways to do everything. Learn to sniff out the one that works for me in this context. It's okay if things need to change. Don't panic. Think. Act. Ask for help when needed.
